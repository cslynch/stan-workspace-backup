**SYNC PROTOCOL (Updated Feb 9, 2026):**

Stan is READ-ONLY on Trello. SuperStan owns all writes.

When Stan completes work:
1. Report to Casey
2. Casey tells SuperStan
3. SuperStan updates master tracker + Trello
4. Stan pulls fresh Trello state to update KANBAN.md

When Stan discovers new tasks:
1. Report to Casey for triage
2. SuperStan creates the card

KANBAN.md is Stan's local scratchpad. It does not flow to Trello.
