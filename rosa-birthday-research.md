## 🎯 STAN'S VERDICT

**Book Brasserie Mon Chou Chou.**

Here's why:
1. Rosa specifically mentioned the pink aesthetic matters (April 22 = spring = she'll want photos)
2. French food is universally romantic without being cliché steakhouse
3. The Pearl is a *destination* - you can walk around after dinner, grab dessert elsewhere, make a whole evening of it
4. Price is right for a special occasion ($60-100pp vs $120pp at Signature)
5. The tableside raclette is *theater* - Instagram content + delicious

### Booking Strategy
- **Call ASAP** - April 22 is a Thursday (good) but spring in SA = busy
- **Request:** Window table or corner banquette if available
- **Time:** 7:00 PM (not too early, not too late, sunset vibes)
- **Mention:** It's her birthday (they might do something special)

### The Full Experience
1. **Dinner at Mon Chou Chou** (2 hours)
2. **Post-dinner stroll** around The Pearl (beautiful at night, string lights, river)
3. **Optional:** Stop at Bakery Lorraine for macarons to-go (also at The Pearl)
4. **Drive home** with good food, good vibes, birthday success

**Little Em's:** Clean, bright, white walls with soft pink accents, modern coastal  
**Mon Chou Chou:** Pastel pink walls, brass fixtures, French cafe chairs, romantic lighting

**For Rosa's vibe:** Mon Chou Chou wins on aesthetic alone.
