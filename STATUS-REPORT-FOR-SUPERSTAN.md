## 6. SUMMARY: WHAT MATTERS TO PROTECT

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Unique, Hard to Recreate)

**DO NOT LOSE THESE FILES:**

1. **JOB-HUNTING-MISSION-BRIEF.md** (9.8 KB)
   - Why: Canonical master plan for entire 90-day job hunting mission
   - Recreate time: 4-6 hours
   - Location: Git ✓ (SAFE)

2. **PHASE-1-EXECUTION.md** (6.75 KB)
   - Why: Detailed execution blueprint with Airtable schema, search criteria, templates
   - Recreate time: 2-3 hours
   - Location: Git ✓ (SAFE)

3. **twitter-launch-package.md** (14.9 KB)
   - Why: 15 tweet singles, 10 reply templates, 2 threads, 3 bios (hours of research/writing)
   - Recreate time: 3-4 hours
   - Location: Local, NOT IN GIT ⚠️ (AT RISK)

4. **stanleybodewell-week-1-posts.md** (4.7 KB)
   - Why: Approved daily posts with timing, ready to execute
   - Recreate time: 2-3 hours
   - Location: Local, NOT IN GIT ⚠️ (AT RISK)

5. **.env** (915 bytes)
   - Why: All API keys (Twitter ×2, Apollo, Airtable)
   - Recreate time: 30 min (regenerate keys) + reconfigure
   - Location: Local, NOT ENCRYPTED ⚠️ (CRITICAL RISK)

6. **MEMORY.md** (locked strategic memory)
   - Why: All decisions, context, mission tracking
   - Recreate time: Cannot be recreated (institutional knowledge)
   - Location: Git ✓ (SAFE)

### 🟡 MEDIUM (Useful, Recreable)

- `dream-100-targets.md` — Recreable in 30 min
- `KANBAN.md` — Recreable in 1 hour
- `AUTOMATION.md` — Recreable in 30 min
- `30-day-execution-plan.md` — Recreable in 2 hours (strategy is in memory)

### 🟢 LOW (Nice to Have, Easily Replaceable)

- Airtable data (25 companies) — Recreable in 1-2 hours
- HTML exports, rendered dashboards — Regenerable from markdown
- Analysis/research logs — Recreable with Apollo re-search

### 💥 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

1. **Git commit the Twitter files** (twitter-launch-package.md, stanleybodewell-week-1-posts.md)
   - Currently local only, should be in version control
   
2. **Encrypt .env file** (GPG with Casey's passphrase)
   - 6 active API keys at risk
   - Backup encrypted copy to Google Drive
   
3. **Back up Airtable data**
   - Set up daily CSV export (if base is critical)
   - Or accept 1-2 hour data loss RTO

4. **Set up Gmail OAuth** (Phase 2 blocker)
   - Enables job search outreach automation
   
5. **Install Salesforce Dev Edition** (Phase 2 blocker)
   - Sets up interview prep infrastructure

## 7. READY FOR SUPERSTAN ANALYSIS

**Questions for SuperStan at claude.ai:**

1. What's the ROI on encrypting + backing up .env vs rotating keys monthly?
2. Should we back up Airtable nightly, or is 1-2 hour RTO acceptable for job hunt data?
3. Priority: Gmail OAuth setup or Salesforce Dev Edition first?
4. Which planned automations are worth building vs manual?
5. Any architecture changes for job hunting mission at scale?
