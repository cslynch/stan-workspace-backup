# Job Hunting Mission Brief - Stan's Core Mission

## Primary Objective
Get Casey hired as a B2B Account Executive (AE or Senior AE, $100k+ OTE) at a Series A-C SaaS company within 90 days.

## Why This Matters
90% of B2B AE roles require Salesforce fluency. Without SFDC on your resume + demonstrated sales ops chops, you're automatically filtered as "junior" or "not serious." Stan's job is to make you credible and interview-ready.

## Critical Interview Scenarios to Master

### Scenario 1: "Walk me through your sales process"
**Without prep:** "I'd qualify the lead, send emails, and follow up."
**With Stan prep:** "I'd capture the lead in Salesforce, run enrichment through Apollo to validate fit, sequence them through a 7-touch cadence, and track engagement in SFDC. Once they hit our lead score threshold, I'd request a discovery call. In Salesforce, I'd move them from MQL to SQL stage..."

### Scenario 2: "Give me an example of using data to improve your process"
**Without prep:** "I looked at the numbers and optimized my outreach."
**With Stan prep:** "I built a Salesforce report that tracked close rate by lead source and noticed our webinar leads converted 3x better than cold outreach. I shifted 60% of my prospecting time to webinar follow-up and increased my quota attainment from 85% to 112% that quarter. Here's the actual dashboard I built [pull it up]."

### Scenario 3: "Tell me about your tech stack"
**Without prep:** "I use Salesforce and email."
**With Stan prep:** "I use Salesforce for CRM and forecasting, Apollo for lead research and enrichment, [email tool] for outreach sequences, and I've built automation to sync Apollo enrichment directly into Salesforce custom fields. I also track engagement metrics in Salesforce reports to optimize my prospecting."
