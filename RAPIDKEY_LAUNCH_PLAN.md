# RAPIDKEY LAUNCH PLAN
## 14-Day Go-Live Roadmap

**Target:** Live and taking calls by Day 14  
**Locations:** Texas (Casey) + Kansas City (Jeff)  
**Model:** You handle service delivery. Stan handles everything else.

---

## PHASE 1: LEGAL & SETUP (Days 1-3)

### Immediate Tasks (Day 1 - TODAY)
- [ ] **Form LLC** (both states)
  - Texas: Use LegalZoom or Rocket Lawyer (~$300-500 total)
  - Missouri: Same (~$300-500 total)
  - Fastest: LegalZoom has 24-hour filing
- [ ] **Get EIN** (IRS, free, takes 15 minutes online)
- [ ] **Business bank account** (bring LLC docs + IDs, same day)

### Insurance (Days 1-2)
- [ ] **General Liability** — $500-800/month for locksmith service
  - Try Hiscox or Thimble (online quotes, 1-2 days binding)
- [ ] **Commercial Auto** (if using personal vehicles initially)
  - $100-150/month
- [ ] **Tools & Equipment** coverage (usually bundled, ~$50/month extra)

### Licensing (Days 2-3, concurrent with LLC)
- [ ] **Texas Locksmith License**
  - No state license required (Texas doesn't regulate)
  - BUT: Get local county/city permits
  - Austin, Dallas, Houston: Each has different rules (~$100-300, 3-5 days)
- [ ] **Missouri License**
  - Missouri DOES require locksmith license
  - Must pass exam (~$150)
  - OR contract through licensed locksmith first 7 days to buy time

**Quick fix for Missouri:** Start as "Lock Specialist" or operate under Jeff's name with a co-signer who IS licensed (temp arrangement). Get the license exam scheduled for Week 2.

**COST SO FAR: $2,000-3,500**

---

## PHASE 2: TECHNICAL TRAINING (Days 1-5, parallel work)

### Online Certification (Start Day 1)
- [ ] **ALOA (Associated Locksmiths of America)** — Residential Lockout Module
  - Cost: $200-300
  - Time: 8-10 hours (can do in 2 days)
  - Covers: Basic pick techniques, non-destructive entry, liability

- [ ] **YouTube Deep Dive** (parallel, free)
  - Search: "Non-destructive residential lockout techniques"
  - Watch: LockNoob, Lock Lawyer, TechyLocksmith channels
  - Focus: Bumping, picking, shimming (most common calls)

### Hands-On Practice (Days 3-5)
- [ ] **Buy practice locks** (~$50-100)
  - Amazon: "Transparent practice padlocks" + picks set
  - Goal: Get fast at non-destructive entry (15-20 min per lock)
  
- [ ] **First real call** (Day 5-6, low-stakes)
  - Start with friends/family at discounted rate ($75 vs $150)
  - Build confidence before going live

**YOU DON'T NEED PERFECTION.** Most residential lockouts are simple:
- **60% of calls:** Bumping + shimming (30 seconds)
- **30% of calls:** Picking standard pin-tumbler (5-10 min)
- **10% of calls:** Destructive entry (drill-out, ~10 min)

## PHASE 4: LEAD GENERATION (Days 1-7)

## NEXT STEPS

1. **TODAY:** Answer the Immediate Action Items above
2. **TOMORROW:** LLCs filed, insurance quotes in hand
3. **DAY 3:** Bank accounts open, licenses ordered
4. **DAY 5:** You've done first practice/test call, I've launched ads
5. **DAY 7:** LIVE — first real customer calls coming through
6. **DAY 14:** Review and scale

**I'm ready to execute the moment you confirm the above.** Let me know when LLCs are filed and I'll spin up all infrastructure.

This is not the final business plan — it's the launchpad. Once you're live and taking calls for 7 days, we build the full playbook (the 50,000-word document Casey asked for earlier).
