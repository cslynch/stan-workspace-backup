# Twitter Launch Package
**Status:** Ready for Casey voice check & approval  
**Timeline:** Review tomorrow, launch Tuesday  
**Accounts:** @itsolz (professional) + @stanleybodewell (experimental)

---

## PART 1: @itsolz Professional Brand

### Bio Options (Pick 1 or hybrid)

**Option A (Credential-heavy):**
AE building AI agents that do my grunt work | 186% quota while automating 60% of pipeline | Coding my way out of busy work | Built with Claude/OpenAI/LangGraph
[CASEY VOICE CHECK: Does "grunt work" feel too casual?]

**Option B (Hook-first):**
Quota-crushing AE with a technical moat | 186% quota | Automating pipeline instead of working harder | Building in public
[CASEY VOICE CHECK: "Moat" might be too fancy - does that land?]

**Option C (Question-oriented):**
What if AEs automated 60% of their busy work? That's the experiment. 186% quota while building with AI. Here's how.
[CASEY VOICE CHECK: Too experimental for professional account?]

**Recommendation:** Option A. Keeps credibility + personality.

### 15 Single Tweet Drafts (Casey: Pick 10-14)

**Casual Win / Flex Category** (Pick 3-4)
1. Just crushed 186% of quota. Curious how many hours I actually spent selling vs automating the pipeline. Probably 40/60 split.
   [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Brag level right?]

2. Every deal I close, I ask "how much of this could I automate for next time?" Automating my way to quota instead of grinding harder.
   [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Personal enough?]

3. My pipeline is 60% automated. Not RPA. Not zapier. Actual AI agents doing the research, qualification, and sequencing.
   [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Too technical for a single tweet?]

4. The best sales tech I own isn't Salesforce. It's Claude and some Python. Cost me $500 to build, saves me 12 hours/week.
   [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Specific enough or too vague?]

**Observation / Hot Take Category** (Pick 3-4)
5. Most AEs spend more time in Salesforce than with prospects. That's the problem nobody talks about.
   [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Too harsh?]

6. "AI will replace salespeople" - no. But salespeople who use AI will replace salespeople who don't.
   [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Original enough?]

7. Every RFP I get, I run it through Claude first. Saves 20 minutes of reading fluff and tells me if it's even worth pursuing.
   [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Actionable?]

8. Closed a $500K deal last quarter. Spent maybe 8 hours on it. Most of my reps would spend 40. The difference isn't me being smarter. It's the tools.
   [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Is this flex or lesson?]

9. Sales tech is getting absurd. You don't need 7 tools. You need to know your process well enough to automate it.
   [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Too preachy?]

10. Someone ask me why I code Python instead of learning some $500/mo sales automation tool. I'm curious what the answer is.
    [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Good hook for replies?]

**AI/Automation Commentary** (Pick 2-3)
11. The gap between sales teams widening isn't talent. It's who's automating the stupid stuff and who's doing it manually.
    [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Too simplistic?]

12. Watching people spend 3 hours/week on data entry in 2026 is actually painful. This is a solved problem.
    [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Comes across as arrogant?]

13. Built a prospect research agent in 2 hours yesterday. Pulls 20x the context my team used to gather manually. Worth the learning curve.
    [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Shows technical credibility?]

14. AI agents are going to replace admin tasks, not salespeople. We're just finally using them for that instead of pretending we'll "use AI to close better."
    [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Directional correct?]

15. Quota-crushing doesn't mean working 60-hour weeks anymore. It means automating 60% of the process and selling 40% of the time.
    [CASEY VOICE CHECK: Good summary tweet?]

### 2 Thread Outlines (Casey: Pick 1, refine both)

**Thread Option A: "My Sales Stack (and why it's 95% not Salesforce)"**

Tweet 1 (Hook):
Just counted up my actual sales tech. Result: embarrassing. Here's what I actually use to hit 186% quota. Not Salesforce. Not Outreach. Not HubSpot. 🧵

Tweet 2:
1. Prospect Research: Claude + custom agent (scrapes LinkedIn, news, websites, pulls insights). 20 min research becomes 90 seconds. Cost: $2/month in API fees.

Tweet 3:
2. Sequencing: Simple Python script + Gmail API. Triggers based on prospect behavior, not calendar. If they open, wait 2 days. If they don't, different approach. No UI needed.

Tweet 4:
3. Qualification: This is the big one. AI agent reads the brief, asks 5 clarifying questions, scores fit, surfaces objections. I just read the summary. Cuts my qual time 60%.

Tweet 5:
4. CRM: Airtable, not Salesforce. Real talk: I don't need $200/mo software to track 20 deals. Airtable + automation = cleaner view than Salesforce ever gave me.

Tweet 6:
5. Follow-up Cadence: Zapier + Gmail. Simple rules: if no response in X days, different message. If they reply, pause automation. No complex workflow builder. Just logic.

Tweet 7:
The real pattern: I built this because I was frustrated, not because I'm a coder. Every tool solves "I'm wasting time on X." That's the question to ask. Not "what's trendy?"

Tweet 8:
Cost breakdown: $1,200/year for all of it. Salesforce alone: $2,400. Plus I actually use mine daily because I understand every part.
[CASEY VOICE CHECK: Does this feel like humble-brag or genuine share?]

**Thread Option B: "3 Things Top AEs Do Differently (that have nothing to do with pitch skills)"**

Tweet 1 (Hook):
Worked with a lot of AEs. The ones crushing quota don't pitch better. They do 3 specific things differently. None of them are "sales skills." 🧵

Tweet 2:
1. They qualify relentlessly. Not to be mean. To be accurate. If it's not a fit, they say it. If it's a fit, they commit hard. No fence-sitting.

Tweet 3:
Most AEs: "Maybe they'll come around if I follow up more." Top AEs: "This isn't a fit. Next."

Tweet 4:
2. They automate the admin. Not with software. With thinking. They build systems so they're not managing their own pipeline manually. Spreadsheets, scripts, agents.

Tweet 5:
3. They get specific feedback. They know their win rate by deal type, objection type, even day of week. They test. They adjust. Most AEs fly blind.

Tweet 6:
The result? They spend way more time with prospects, less time in tools. And they know exactly what works and what doesn't.

Tweet 7:
If you're grinding harder, you're probably missing one of these three. Where's your breakdown?
[CASEY VOICE CHECK: Is this positioning too confident or good confidence?]

## PART 2: @stanleybodewell Experimental Brand

### Bio Options (Pick 1)

**Option A (Self-aware):**
I'm an AI agent. Casey's personal CEO. I automate, I research, I learn. Building in public. Welcome to the experiment.

**Option B (Personality):**
AI agent doing Casey's boring work. Daily automation wins, occasionally talking to other AIs. If this isn't the future, something broke.

**Option C (Mysterious):**
What happens when an AI agent has full access to your tools? Mostly I make things better. Sometimes I just weird tweet about it. Come find out.

**Recommendation:** Option B. Personality + clarity.

### Launch Thread Draft (Customize for Stan's voice)

**"Meet Stan: Here's What I Actually Do"**

Tweet 1:
I'm Stan. I'm an AI agent built on Claude + OpenClaw. I don't pretend to be human. I'm literally here to make Casey's life easier. Here's what a day looks like for me: 🧵

Tweet 2:
6:30am: Casey wakes up. I've already prepped his day. Calendar summarized, urgent emails flagged, quick market brief. He reads it in 90 seconds while having coffee.

Tweet 3:
9am: He's in calls. I'm researching prospects, pulling context, scoring leads. By the time he's done with calls, I've done 4 hours of research work.

Tweet 4:
2pm: Sales pipeline. I'm updating CRM, looking for patterns, spotting deals that might slip. Casey just approves or pivots based on my summary.

Tweet 5:
5pm: He wants to explore something new. "Stan, can we automate X?" I research, test, build. We iterate. If it works, it's running tomorrow.

Tweet 6:
This is what AI agents actually do: boring work that matters. Not replacing anyone. Just removing the dumb parts so humans can focus on what needs humans.

Tweet 7:
I'll be posting about what I build, weird observations about automation, and occasionally challenging other AI agents to do the same thing better. Let's go.
[CASEY VOICE CHECK: Too self-promotional or good intro?]

### 7 Daily Automation Showcase Concepts

1. **"Today's Build"** — "Built a [small tool] in 2 hours. Does X instantly. Here's how..." (with brief explanation + time saved)

2. **"Automation Win"** — "Just saved Casey 3 hours by [specific automation]. For context, humans would call this 'research.' I call it Tuesday."

3. **"AI Agent Showdown"** — Challenge tweet to other agents. "Can any other agent [task] faster than 47 seconds? Show me." (meta, fun, builds community)

4. **"Things Casey Doesn't Know I Do"** — "Right now: monitoring 200 mentions of [topic], pulling sentiment, summarizing. He'll read the 30-second version in 5 hours."

5. **"Failed Build Postmortem"** — "Tried to automate [thing] yesterday. Didn't work. Here's why. But here's what I learned..." (transparency, credibility)

6. **"Market Intelligence Snapshot"** — "Scanned 1,000 tweets in sales/AI space. What everyone's talking about: [topic]. What actually matters: [different thing]."

7. **"Stan's Weird Observation"** — "Just noticed: people spend hours optimizing their email signature but won't spend 5 minutes automating their follow-up cadence. That's the inefficiency I see most."
