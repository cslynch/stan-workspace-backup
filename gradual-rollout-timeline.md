# Gradual Rollout Timeline (Feb 3-7)
**SuperStan Decision:** Gradual rollout instead of all-at-once launch  
**Benefit:** Test each layer, catch issues, build momentum

---

## Timeline (5 Days to Full Launch)

### Monday Feb 3 - APPROVAL DAY
**What happens:**
- Casey reviews twitter-launch-package.md
- Casey voice-checks @stanleybodewell week 1 posts
- Casey approves bios, singles, threads
- All content finalized by EOD

**Stan's parallel work:**
- Nothing posted yet
- Prep Dream 100 reply targets
- Load all approved content into scheduling system
- Confirm everything is ready to go

**Why:** Make sure content is locked before we start pushing.

### Tuesday Feb 4 - REPLIES ONLY (@itsolz)
**What posts:**
- NO original @itsolz content yet
- NO @stanleybodewell posts
- ONLY: @itsolz replies to Dream 100 accounts (using reply templates)

**How many:**
- 3 high-quality replies to Tier 1 (@Patticus, @morganb, @mikestrives)
- 4 replies to Tier 2 accounts (identified Monday)
- 3 replies to emerging #SalesTwitter conversations

**Why this order:**
- Tests API stability with low-risk content (replies)
- Builds visibility without "spammy" appearance
- Generates early engagement before original posts
- Lets people find your account through conversation threads

**Win condition:** Replies post successfully, some get engagement back.

---

### Wednesday Feb 5 - ADD STAN (@stanleybodewell)
**What posts:**
- Continue @itsolz replies (5-10 more)
- START @stanleybodewell posts (first 2 of 7)
  - Post 1: Introduction (8am)
  - Post 2: First automation showcase (2pm)
- NO @itsolz original content yet

**Why split them:**
- Introduces your AI agent separately
- Lets @stanleybodewell build initial audience
- @itsolz stays focused on engagement/replies
- Tests both accounts' infrastructure independently

**Win condition:** Both accounts post successfully, followers start trickling in.

---

### Thursday Feb 6 - FIRST ORIGINALS (@itsolz)
**What posts:**
- Continue @stanleybodewell (Post 3-4)
- Continue @itsolz replies (5 more)
- START @itsolz first original posts (2 casual singles)
  - Pick 2 from your approved singles list
  - Keep it low-pressure (not a full thread yet)

**Why Thursday not Friday:**
- Gives you feedback before weekend
- Lets content breathe (posted Wed/Thu, engaged Friday)
- No late-week algorithm penalty

**Win condition:** Original @itsolz posts get engagement, people start asking questions.

---

### Friday Feb 7 - FULL SCHEDULE LIVE
**What posts:**
- Continue @stanleybodewell daily (Post 5-7, then into regular rhythm)

- Start @itsolz full posting schedule (3-4 posts per day)
- All automations locked

**What happens:**
- Both accounts at full cadence
- Both reply engines active
- Daily standup posted (Stan)
- Observation/commentary posts (Stan)

**Why Friday:**
- Market attention is high (Friday news cycle)
- Momentum from Tue-Thu activity

**Win condition:** Full orchestrated operation running, metrics flowing.

## Rollout Safety Checks

### Daily (Tue-Fri):
- [ ] Posts went out on time
- [ ] API calls successful (no 403/429 errors)
- [ ] No @itsolz/Stan mentions got flagged as spam
- [ ] Followers increasing (even if slow)
- [ ] Any replies show up normally

### If Something Breaks:
- Pause that account's posts
- Debug immediately
- Investigate root cause
- Fix and resume (don't wait)

### If Engagement is Zero:
- It's fine Tuesday/Wednesday (accounts are new)
- By Thursday, you should see some likes/replies
- If still zero Friday, revisit content (but probably too early to judge)

---

## Data Collection During Rollout

**What to track (even if manual):**
- Daily: New followers (both accounts)
- Daily: Engagement on each post (likes/retweets/replies)
- Daily: DM volume (both accounts)
- Daily: Any @ mentions
- Friday: Take a snapshot of all metrics

**Why:** Sunday's analysis depends on this data.

---

## Mental Model

**Tue-Wed:** "Are the lights on?" (Infrastructure check)
**Thu:** "Does anyone notice?" (Engagement signal)
**Fri:** "Is this working?" (Data analysis begins)
**Sun:** "What changes for Week 2?" (Direction decision)

---

**Status:** Rollout timeline locked. Ready to execute Monday Feb 3.
