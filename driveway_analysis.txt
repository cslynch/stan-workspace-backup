Strategy: Flip/resale
Key Issue: Steep driveway grade

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RISK ANALYSIS - ASPHALT ON STEEP GRADE

⚠️ Heat Softening
Texas summer heat can soften asphalt, leading to rutting on steep grades,
especially during buyer showings when vehicles park/turn.

⚠️ Drainage & Erosion
Steep slopes amplify drainage issues. If drainage isn't perfect, asphalt is
more vulnerable to washout and edge degradation than concrete.

⚠️ Maintenance Before Sale
Asphalt requires resealing every 3-5 years (~$500-1,000). New asphalt won't
need this immediately, but buyers may perceive it as higher maintenance.

⚠️ Perceived Value
On new construction in hill country, asphalt may read as "budget" vs concrete
which signals "finished/premium."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ADVANTAGES - CONCRETE FOR FLIP

✓ Buyer Perception
Concrete reads as finished and premium on new construction. Matches buyer
expectations for higher-end hill country properties.

✓ Zero Maintenance
Set it and forget it. No resealing, no soft spots, no ruts. Clean through
closing.

✓ Grade Performance
Concrete doesn't soften in heat. No rutting risk on steep grades. Handles
heavy vehicle traffic without deformation.

✓ Longevity Signal
Buyers see 30-40 year lifespan as a selling point, even though they won't
own it that long. It's about perceived quality.

✓ Neighborhood Standard
Hill country new builds typically have concrete driveways. Asphalt may stand
out negatively during comps.

RECOMMENDATION OPTIONS

Option 1: Full Concrete ($42,805.87)
────────────────────────────────────
Best for resale value and eliminating all grade/drainage risk.
Consider: Negotiate MTL down to $38-40k. Ask if they can sharpen pencil on
materials or timeline.

Option 2: Hybrid Approach (Estimated $35-38k)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Concrete the steep section (first 500-800 SF where grade is worst).
Asphalt the flat/parking area.
Balances cost savings with risk mitigation.
Would need MTL to re-quote this configuration.

Option 3: Full Asphalt ($29,915.82)
────────────────────────────────────
Only viable if:
• Grade is under 8%
• Neighboring comps have asphalt
• Selling price/margin can absorb perceived value hit

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DECISION FACTORS

1. What's the actual grade percentage?
   Measure/verify slope. If >10%, asphalt is high-risk. If 5-8%, marginal
   but doable.

2. What do comps have?
   Drive nearby new builds. If all concrete, match the standard.

3. Expected sale price?
   If selling $400k+, buyers expect concrete. If sub-$300k, asphalt might fly.

4. Margin tolerance?
   How tight is the flip budget? Can you absorb $42k driveway or does it blow
   the numbers?

5. Time to sale?
   If selling this spring/summer, asphalt will be tested immediately by heat.
   Fall/winter sale gives more buffer.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

NEXT STEPS

☐ Measure actual driveway grade percentage
☐ Survey 3-5 comparable new construction properties for driveway type
☐ Call MTL to negotiate concrete price (target $38-40k)
☐ Ask MTL for hybrid quote (concrete steep section + asphalt flat)
☐ Review flip pro forma with driveway cost options
☐ Make decision by Feb 10 (quotes valid through March 5)
