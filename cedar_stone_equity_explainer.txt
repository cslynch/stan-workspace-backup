Method B equalizes losses (both at -67.7% ROI).

KEY DIFFERENCES AT $300K SALE:

                        Method A        Method B        Delta

Method B equalizes losses (both at -41.2% ROI).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RECOMMENDATION:

Both scenarios show LOSSES at $250k and $300k sale prices because total invested ($177,610) exceeds net proceeds after costs.

Break-even sale price (Method A): ~$285,000
Break-even sale price (Method B): ~$285,000

To make profit, need to sell above $285k OR reduce projected costs (e.g., cheaper driveway, hold longer to reduce urgency).

DECISION FRAMEWORK:

Choose Method A (Operating Expenses) if:
- Original equity contributions were meant to define ownership
- Post-purchase costs were understood as shared expenses
- Partners are comfortable with 79/21 split on profits/losses

Choose Method B (Additional Equity) if:
- Every dollar spent should count toward ownership
- Partners want risk/reward proportional to total capital deployed
- Fairness means equal ROI regardless of who funded what

This decision should be documented in your Operating Agreement before either property sells.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

NEXT STEPS:

1. Decide which method reflects your partnership intent
2. Document the decision in an Operating Agreement
3. Apply consistently to Oak Trail and all future properties
4. Update exit calcs spreadsheet with the chosen method
5. Add missing projected costs ($42k driveway, holding costs, HELOC interest)
6. Re-run scenarios at realistic sale prices ($300k-400k range)
