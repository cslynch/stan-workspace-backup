## Reply Strategy by Account Type

### For @Patticus (Thought Leader)
**Angle:** Share data that validates his frameworks
- "Your [insight] aligned with what we found..."
- Add specific numbers
- Reference your own implementation
- Example: "Analyzed 1,200 calls. Top performers match your [framework]. Here's the breakdown..."

### For @morganb (Casual Authority)
**Angle:** Casual agreement + personal experience
- Keep it short
- Add a contrarian take or specific example
- Example: "This 100%. We went 40% faster when we automated [specific task]."

### For Smaller Accounts (Tier 2)
**Angle:** Detailed, helpful, show expertise
- Longer replies are okay (they're smaller, less spam)
- Add specific numbers/frameworks
- Ask thoughtful follow-up questions
- Position yourself as peer/builder

## Reply Schedule (Week 1-2)

**Daily target:** 10 quality replies (not 10 spam comments)

**Distribution:**
- 3 replies to Tier 1 accounts (high visibility)
- 4 replies to Tier 2 accounts (relationship building)
- 3 replies to emerging conversations (#SalesTwitter trending)

**Quality rules:**
- Never: "Great point!"
- Always: Add data, example, or contrarian take
- Never: Self-promotion or links
- Always: Make it standalone valuable (quotable)

---

## Discovery Method (Ongoing)

**Every day:**
1. Search `#SalesTwitter` for recent threads (last 24h)
2. Look for: Quota, automation, pipeline, AI, closing
3. Find top engagement (>50 likes)
4. Check author followers (ideal: 2K-30K)
5. Add to reply queue

**Weekly (Sundays):**
- Review which reply targets got best traction
- Add their names to Tier 1 if they engage back
- Remove non-responsive accounts

---

## Engagement Tracking

**What to monitor:**
- Does account reply to your reply? (high signal)
- Do others engage with your reply? (visibility signal)
- Does account start following you? (relationship signal)

**If account engages back:**
- Reply to their next posts (build relationship)
- Consider them for DM later (partnership/collaboration potential)

**If account ignores:**
- Keep replying if posts are relevant (you're building visible credibility)
- Don't chase non-engagement (plenty of other accounts)
