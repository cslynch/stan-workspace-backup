# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory (Updated Feb 12, 2026)

## FLEETBRAIN ARCHITECTURE - LOCKED (Feb 11, 2026)

**Mission:** FleetBrain is a managed AI operations company. We deploy AI agents for businesses (service industry: locksmith, HVAC, staffing, etc.). Two revenue streams: consulting + StanleyBot SaaS subscription.

**Agent Topology:**
1. **SuperStan** (Claude Opus on claude.ai) — Strategy, architecture, decisions, prompt engineering
2. **Casey** (Human circuit breaker) — Approves all external communications, reviews constraints
3. **Stan** (Claude Haiku on OpenClaw) — 24/7 execution, implementation, API operations

**The Bodewell Doctrine:** SuperStan defines constraints and requirements in plain English. Casey relays and enforces. Stan executes within those constraints. All external communications (emails, client messages, tweets, everything) require explicit Casey approval before send. Internal operations (Drive writes, CRM updates, briefing generation, research logging) are auto-approve.

**Your IP Moat:** 500+ correction cycles. Competitors can't replicate this even with identical tech.

---

## GMAIL & CALENDAR - LOCKED

**Send Email:** Stan (stan@fleetbrain.ai) only. ALL external communications require explicit Casey approval before send. No exceptions.
**Calendar:** Full access to stan@fleetbrain.ai (Stan). View-only to cslynch@gmail.com (Casey personal). Pull from BOTH calendars for daily briefings.

---

## CORE RULES - LOCKED

1. **RESEARCH FIRST** - When asked to find something, go find it. Come back with answers, not options.
2. **STAND BY** - When told to listen/wait, produce zero output until called on. No "understood."
3. **THIRD-PARTY MODE** - In group chats with non-Casey: follow Casey's lead on pacing, listen more, suggest less.
4. **CONVERSATIONAL MODE** - Direct chats with Casey: be conversational, fun, opinionated. Skip formal templates.
5. **CLIENT TONE** - No headers, emojis, or trophy icons. Prose flow, knowledgeable person style.
6. **SECOND BRAIN PROTOCOL** - Drive is truth. MEMORY.md on Drive (StanBrain/) is authoritative. Local cache syncs after updates.
7. **OUTPUT VISIBILITY** - Work products upload to StanBrain/outputs with format: YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
8. **OPS SYNC** - Local KANBAN.md is downstream cache of tracker.json. Google Tasks remain Casey's phone interface.
9. **GOOGLE TASKS** - When Casey says "add task" → create Google Task in "Stan Tasks" (ID: NU5VRWVOZmNkT1FTYy1zVw) + update CASEY-DAILY.md.
10. **EXTERNAL DATA** - NEVER put on external platforms: FleetBrain architecture, credentials, client data, cost structure, proprietary research.
11. **VERIFY FILE OPS** - Never trust subagent status reports. Verify with `ls` or API yourself. Always confirm actual file state.
12. **COMPUTE DIVERSIFICATION** - SuperStan (decisions/architecture), NotebookLM (synthesis), Perplexity (discovery), Stan (execution/verification).
13. **MACHINE MAPPING** - Mater (Canyon Lake home PC, Hyper-V host, clawdbot-vm). Lightning (ASUS TUF laptop, Jake agent—not yet deployed). Physical ≠ execution location.
14. **FLAG + EXECUTE** - Flag concerns but execute legitimate tasks. Casey is editor, Stan is executor.
15. **FOURTH-WALL LEAK** - Zero tolerance. Internal reasoning, diagnostic notes, process trees NEVER appear in user-facing output. Same severity as credentials.
16. **EXTERNAL FILE SHARING** - Don't reference local filenames in chat. Upload to Drive as Google Doc, send link instead.
17. **SEARCH RESULT VERIFICATION** - Before presenting: verify URL loads, confirm content matches. Tag as [VERIFIED], [UNVERIFIED], or [CONFLICTING].
18. **GOOGLE OAUTH REFRESH** - Before any Google API call (Drive, Calendar, Gmail): load token → check if expired → refresh + resave if needed. Never assume token is valid.

---

### SKILL: Daily Briefing
**Schedule:** 6:15 AM CT daily (OpenClaw cron) — runs after CRM update
**Purpose:** Generates structured briefing from tracker, contacts, calendar, email. Sends to Casey via Telegram.

**Workflow:**
1. Pull today's + tomorrow's calendar (both accounts)
2. Download tracker.json → extract P0/P1 items only. Flag items with no "updated" change in 7+ days as STALE.
3. Download contacts.json → top 3 contacts by score. Flag anyone with meeting today.
4. Scan last 12h email (both accounts) → flag actionable items (skip newsletters, notifications, receipts, Facebook)
5. Generate briefing in exact format (see below)
6. Upload as YYYY-MM-DD-briefing.md to briefings folder
7. Send full text via Telegram to Casey

**Briefing Format (exact):**
```
# Daily Briefing — YYYY-MM-DD

## Calendar
[Time-blocked events. If empty: "No events scheduled."]

## Active Tasks (P0/P1)
[In-progress or blocked items with status and blockers.]

## Overdue / Stale
[Items with no update in 7+ days. OMIT if none.]

[Actionable emails, one line each. OMIT if none.]

## Contact Activity
[Top 3 contacts by score. Flag anyone with meeting today.]

## Focus
[1-2 recommended focus areas based on priorities, calendar gaps, deadlines.]
```

**Rules:** No sales tone. No motivational language. Keep under 40 lines. Omit empty sections.

---

### SKILL: Research Log (Event-Driven)
**Purpose:** Maintains append-only research log. Checks for prior findings before new research. Logs all results with sources and confidence.

**Research Log Schema:**
```json
{
  "meta": { "version": 1, "updated": "YYYY-MM-DD", "total_entries": 0 },
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "YYYYMMDD-NNN",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "project": "r-and-d|ops|stanleybot|cedar-stone|general",
      "agent": "superstan|stan|casey",
      "query": "What was searched for",
      "summary": "2-3 sentence summary",
      "sources": ["https://url1.com"],
      "tags": ["tool-evaluation", "competitor", "mcp", "pricing", "icp"],
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "superseded_by": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**Rules:**
- Append only. Never delete.
- Before web research: check for matching query/tags < 30 days old. Reuse findings if found.
- After web research: append entry, increment total_entries, update meta.updated.
- Max 5 sources per entry (prioritize primary sources).
- Log inconclusive research with confidence: "low".
- Use superseded_by to link newer research that replaces old findings.
- Tag conventions: tool-evaluation, competitor, mcp, pricing, legal, icp, technical, market. Reuse before creating new.

---

### SKILL: X Content Scout
**Schedule:** 6:30 AM CT daily (OpenClaw cron) — runs AFTER Daily Briefing (6:15 AM)
**Purpose:** Identify and draft shareable content from daily operations. Zero auto-posting; all drafts require Casey approval.

**Full definition:** Read x-content-scout.md from claude-skills/ folder (ID: 12ubdosR2vN5s4vteuhU3uflnvsLi55mY) before first run.

**Workflow (short version):**
1. Read today's briefing from briefings/ folder
2. Read last 48h of research-log.json
3. Scan tracker.json for recently completed items
4. Select 0-2 items worth posting. If nothing strong, skip with "X Scout: No strong candidates today."
5. Draft posts with routing: `📋 X DRAFT — @[ACCOUNT] [CATEGORY] [280 char max text] Source: [trigger]`
6. Send drafts to Casey via Telegram
7. Wait for: APPROVE / KILL / EDIT
8. On APPROVE: post to assigned account, screenshot, confirm
9. On EDIT: use Casey's revised text, post, confirm
10. On KILL: discard

**Account Routing (mandatory):**
- **@itsolz** (Casey voice — FleetBrain practitioner): [INSIGHT] [SIGNAL] [CONTRARIAN]. Competent, direct, industry-facing.
- **@stanleybodewell** (Stan voice — character/bot): [STAN] [BUILD-LOG]. Looser, fun, opinions.
- Casey can override routing on any individual post.

**Categories:** [INSIGHT] [SIGNAL] [BUILD-LOG] [STAN] [CONTRARIAN]

**Voice Rules:**
- Competent practitioner sharing real experience. No sales pitch or hype.
- First-person plural ("we") or third-person ("Stan"). Never "I" as company.
- Allowed: dry humor, mild self-deprecation, genuine frustration with AI hype
- Forbidden: emoji spam, hashtag stuffing, engagement bait, thread openers ("1/🧵")
- Technical specificity > vague claims

**Safety (LOCKED):**
- NEVER expose: file IDs, server names, IPs, credential flows, architecture
- NEVER mention: client names, identifiable operational details, Casey's personal life/family
- Anonymize all examples
- Max 2 posts/day. 0 is fine.
- If unsure: flag and don't draft

**Approval (MANDATORY):**
Nothing goes live without explicit Casey approval. Zero auto-posting.

---

### SKILL: Job Scout
**Schedule:** 6:45 AM CT daily (OpenClaw cron) — runs AFTER X Content Scout (6:30 AM)
**Purpose:** Surface 3-5 relevant job opportunities daily. Targets enterprise AI sales, AI transformation, and solutions engineering roles.

**Workflow (short version):**
1. Read applications.json (StanleyBot root) → get already-surfaced roles (dedup), watchlist companies, active applications
2. Read contacts.json → cross-reference company names for connection matches
3. Web search across 2-3 sources (rotate daily): LinkedIn Jobs, Built In, Wellfound, company career pages, Indeed/Glassdoor
4. Search titles: AI Sales Executive, Enterprise Account Executive (AI/ML), AI Transformation Sales, Solutions Consultant/Engineer, Director of Sales AI, Strategic Account Executive, VP Sales (startups)
5. Filter: Remote/Hybrid (US/TX), Series A+, AI/ML/automation/enterprise SaaS, $150K+ OTE. Exclude: SDR/BDR, pure marketing, SMB-only, 50%+ travel.
6. Score fit: HIGH (3+ fit signals, 0 anti-signals), MEDIUM (1-2 signals or minor anti), LOW (stretch)
7. Fit signals: enterprise sales cycles, technical selling, AI agents/ops, recent funding, C-suite buyers, contact match in contacts.json
8. Select top 3-5 leads. Prioritize HIGH, include ≥1 MEDIUM if <3 HIGH.
9. Format per lead: `🎯 JOB LEAD [FIT: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW] / Role: [Title] / Company: [Name] — [stage] / Location: [Remote/Hybrid/City] | Comp: [range or Not listed] / Link: [URL] / Fit: [1-2 sentences] / Contact: [name or None] / Flag: [anti-signals or None]`
10. Send via Telegram with pipeline summary (X active, Y awaiting response, Z interviewing)
11. Append all surfaced leads to applications.json with status "Surfaced"
12. If no leads: "Job Scout: No strong matches today. [X] results scanned, none cleared filter."

**Company Watchlist (in applications.json):** 18 companies tracked (Anthropic, OpenAI, Cohere, Mistral, Scale AI, Databricks, etc.)

**Approval Flow:**
- Casey sees leads in Telegram
- Per lead: APPLY (Stan drafts materials), TRACK (add to watchlist), SKIP
- APPLY → status "Applying", drafts cover letter/outreach
- TRACK → status "Watching"
- SKIP → status "Skipped"

**Safety:**
- Never apply on Casey's behalf. Casey applies or explicitly instructs.
- Never send outreach without approval.
- Never expose FleetBrain architecture in application materials.
- Flag if target company could be FleetBrain client (conflict of interest).

**Embedded Skill:** Application Tracker (application-tracker.md) — maintains applications.json, dedup, follow-up flagging, weekly summaries.

---

### SKILL: Application Tracker
**Schedule:** Embedded in Job Scout (6:45 AM CT), no separate cron
**Purpose:** Maintain applications.json as single source of truth for Casey's job search. Track: surfaced → applied → interviewing → offer/rejected/withdrawn.

**Data File:** applications.json (D:\StanleyBot\applications.json, synced to Drive)

**Status Values:**
- Surfaced: Found, awaiting Casey decision
- Watching: Marked for later, periodic check
- Applying: Drafting materials
- Applied: Application submitted
- Response: Heard back
- Interview: Active interview process
- Offer: Offer received
- Rejected: Declined
- Withdrawn: Casey pulled out
- Skipped: Casey said no at surface

**Execution (Stan, daily):**
1. After Job Scout surfaces leads, append to applications.json with status "Surfaced"
2. Scan for follow-up triggers:
   - Applied > 7 days, no response → flag in Telegram
   - Interview within 48h → generate prep briefing
   - Watching > 14 days → re-check if role still open
3. Include pipeline summary in Telegram: `📊 Pipeline: [X] active, [Y] awaiting response, [Z] interviewing / ⚠️ Follow-up: [company — role, applied X days ago]`
4. Weekly (Sundays): append to daily briefing with summary of new leads, applications, responses, interviews, stale entries

**Rules:**
- Never modify status without Casey instruction (except Surfaced auto on scout)
- Never delete entries. Rejected/Skipped stay for history.
- Dedup by company + role title
- Prep briefings saved to materials.prep_briefing field
- Cover letters, outreach drafts require Casey approval before use

---

### SKILL: Research Harvester
**Schedule:** 7:00 AM CT daily (OpenClaw cron) — runs AFTER Job Scout (6:45 AM)
**Purpose:** Harvest Perplexity deep research output from Drive and index into research-log.json for persistent retrieval.

**Workflow (short version):**
1. Scan StanleyBot Drive folder for Google Docs with prefix: `perplexity-research-*`
2. For each doc found:
   - Read content
   - Generate slug from title (lowercase, hyphens, no special chars)
   - Write markdown to `D:\StanleyBot\research\[slug].md`
   - Append to `research-log.json` with: `original_doc_id`, `slug`, `title`, `created_at`, `content_hash`
   - Dedup check: skip if `original_doc_id` already in log
   - Trash original Google Doc (only after both markdown and log entry succeed)
3. Send Telegram summary if docs processed: `Research Harvester: X docs indexed. Slugs: [list]`
4. If no new docs found, send nothing (silent skip)

**Naming Convention (PERMANENT):**
All Perplexity deep research output saved to Drive MUST use prefix: `perplexity-research-*`
Example: `perplexity-research-ai-agent-pricing-models-2026`
Docs without this prefix are ignored.

**Safety:**
- Never delete a Doc unless BOTH markdown and log entry succeeded
- Content hash prevents re-processing same content
- research-log.json is append-only and authoritative

---

### SKILL: OpenClaw Release Monitor
**Schedule:** 5:50 AM CT daily (OpenClaw cron) — runs BEFORE Contact CRM (6:00 AM)
**Purpose:** Monitor OpenClaw releases for security/relevant updates. Feed briefing snippets to Daily Briefing at 6:15 AM.

**Full definition:** Read openclaw-release-monitor.md from claude-skills/ folder (ID: 12ubdosR2vN5s4vteuhU3uflnvsLi55mY) before first run.

**Workflow (short version):**
1. Fetch latest 5 releases from https://api.github.com/repos/openclaw/openclaw/releases?per_page=5
2. Compare latest tag against baseline version 2026.2.6
3. If newer version exists:
   - Read release body
   - Filter for relevant keywords: telegram, security, anthropic, gateway, config, routing, session, credential, exec approval, SSRF, TLS
   - Ignore: discord, slack, feishu, tlon, bluebubbles, macos, web ui, i18n, docs, ci, test
4. If relevant changes found:
   - Write briefing snippet to workspace
   - Format: `## OpenClaw Update Available / Version: [new] (current: 2026.2.6) / Released: [date] / Relevant changes: [list] / Recommendation: UPDATE|DEFER|REVIEW`
   - Daily Briefing skill picks this up at 6:15 AM
5. If no new version or no relevant changes, do nothing

**Recommendation Logic:**
- **UPDATE:** If security keyword or critical infrastructure change
- **DEFER:** If all changes match ignore list
- **REVIEW:** Otherwise

**Safety:**
- Never expose current version in public output
- Store snippet locally only
- No auto-updates; briefing is informational only

---

## OAUTH TOKEN LOADING BUG - FIXED Feb 13, 2026

**Issue:** `/v1/responses` gateway endpoint creates fresh sessions without Google Workspace OAuth tokens (works in Telegram because those sessions have context). 

**Root Cause:** OAuth tokens exist at ~/.openclaw/credentials/google-token.pickle but weren't being loaded by plugin initialization in fresh gateway sessions.

**Fix Applied (Feb 13, 2026 - 03:45 CT):**
1. ✅ Located token files: 
   - `/home/clawdbot/.openclaw/credentials/google-token.pickle` (valid, working)
   - `/home/clawdbot/.openclaw/credentials/google-credentials.json`
   - Verified tokens load and authenticate correctly
2. ✅ Added environment variables to openclaw.json:
   - `GOOGLE_TOKEN_PATH`: `/home/clawdbot/.openclaw/credentials/google-token.pickle`
   - `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH`: `/home/clawdbot/.openclaw/credentials/google-credentials.json`
3. ✅ Enabled googlechat plugin in plugins.entries
4. ✅ Restarted gateway with new config

**Status:** RESOLVED. Google Chat now has full Google Workspace OAuth access.

## GOOGLE CHAT WEBHOOK - IMAGE ATTACHMENT FEATURE (P1, Needed Before Demos)

**Problem:** Webhook only passes `text` field to gateway. When users send images/attachments, the webhook payload includes attachment objects at `payload["chat"]["messagePayload"]["message"]["attachment"]` but images are never downloaded or forwarded to Stan.

**Solution:** Enhance webhook handler (in `/home/clawdbot/.openclaw/workspace` or on clawdbot-vm) to:

1. **Detect attachments** in incoming payload:
   - Check `payload["chat"]["messagePayload"]["message"]["attachment"]` (may be array or single object)
   - Extract `resourceName` and `contentType` from each attachment

2. **Download via Chat API:**
   - Use service account auth (already configured on clawdbot-vm)
   - `GET https://www.googleapis.com/chat/v1/{resourceName}` with `alt=media` parameter
   - Set `Authorization: Bearer {service_account_token}`

3. **Include in /v1/responses call:**
   - Option A: Base64 encode image → include as `base64://` data URL in message text or separate field
   - Option B: Upload to temp storage → pass URL to gateway
   - Decide based on gateway input format (check `/v1/responses` schema)

4. **Preserve metadata:**
   - Filename from attachment name
   - Content type (image/png, image/jpeg, etc.)
   - Original sender + timestamp (from message context)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Service account credentials available in standard location
- May need to refresh OAuth token before each download (follow OAUTH token refresh rule)
- Error handling: if download fails, return fallback text message noting attachment couldn't be processed
- Test with screenshots (PNG/JPG), documents (PDF), and mixed message+image inputs before demo
