# 2026-02-25 — Daily Operations Log

## Morning Operations

**Time:** 2026-02-25, 06:15–16:00 CT

### 1. TRACKER RECONCILIATION (LOCKED)
- **Task 1** (ICP + pricing + outreach) → Complete ✓
- **Task 2** (Personal AI demo) → Complete ✓
- **Task 3** (fleetbrain.ai website) → Complete ✓
- **Task 4** (stanleybot.fleetbrain.ai website) → Complete ✓
- **Task 26** (Google Chat Spaces) → In Progress (manual process, automate post-Marketplace)
- **LTN-003** → Added blocking note: "Blocked on LTN-002 (Jake OAuth)"
- Metadata updated: last_modified_by "Stan (reconciliation audit)"

### 2. X CONTENT PIPELINE RESET
- **Action:** Cleared stale draft posts from 6:30 AM scout run (2 posts never reviewed → discarded)
- **New Infrastructure:**
  - Created x-drafts/ folder on Drive (ID: 1FFj2Zv8u6J3LsmTWU5Cn9hxiRHvnKXQf)
  - File format: YYYY-MM-DD-x-drafts.md (daily archive)
  - Status workflow: PENDING → APPROVED/EDIT/KILLED (per Casey/SuperStan review)
- **Dual Output:** Telegram summary + Drive archival (no change to Telegram, archival adds review layer)
- **Ready for tomorrow:** Full pipeline configured for 6:30 AM execution

### 3. JOB SCOUT PIPELINE — COMPLETE OVERHAUL
**Part A: Strategic Reset**
- Cleared 5 stale leads from applications.json (outdated, never acted on)
- Updated targeting: Enterprise sales roles ONLY (AE, Strategic AE, Sales Director, VP Sales)
- Explicit exclusions: Solutions Architect, SE, SDR/BDR, marketing, engineering
- Comp filter: $150K+ OTE, $120K-$150K flagged as "tight"
- Geography: Texas or Remote (US)
- Industry: B2B SaaS, AI/automation, infrastructure (selling to enterprise)

**Part B: Source Hierarchy Upgrade**
- PRIMARY sources (every run):
  1. LinkedIn Jobs (exact title search)
  2. Company career pages (3-4 per run, 24-company full cycle every 6 days)
- SECONDARY sources (rotate 1-2):
  3. Built In (B2B SaaS focus)
  4. Wellfound (Series B+ AI/SaaS)
  5. Y Combinator Work at a Startup
- DEPRIORITIZE (fallback only if primary/secondary < 3 leads):
  6-10. RemoteRocketship, Virtual Vocations, Indeed, USARemoteJobs, Google search
- Company tracking system added to MEMORY.md (prevent re-checking companies with no open sales roles)

**Part C: Infrastructure & File IDs**
- Fixed critical bug: applications.json file ID was wrong in job-scout.py (folder ID 1_zJLQo6RGkjesTLbIxOaTPvoGXnYQnYT vs. file ID 1qpoBSTniH1dtfrJXqYJsfGHxXjTMUd1-)
- Refactored job-scout.py to use direct file ID instead of filename search (eliminates collision risk)
- Created job-scout/ folder on Drive (ID: 1_r4ykfESPOwiF6I1d3SfCYkjbReAfVEj)
- Test write/delete verified

**Part D: Live Test (6:45 AM + Re-run at 15:50)**
- **First run (aggregator sources):** 5 leads found (3 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM)
  - Forethought AI (Account Executive – AI/SaaS, Remote, $130K–$160K) — HIGH
  - Synthflow AI (Senior AE, Remote, $140K–$170K) — HIGH
  - Virtual Vocations listing (AE, AI/SaaS, Remote, $130K–$160K) — HIGH
  - Qevlar AI (Enterprise AE, NYC only, $140K–$180K) — MEDIUM (location flag)
  - GeneMetrics (SaaS AE, Remote, $100K–$130K) — MEDIUM (comp below threshold)
- **Re-run (primary sources):** 1 lead found
  - Symmetric Health Solutions (Enterprise AE, Austin/SF/NY/Remote, $140K–$170K) — HIGH
  - Sourced from Wellfound (Series B+ SaaS), much higher quality than aggregators
- **Quality comparison:** Primary sources (Wellfound) beat aggregators on comp transparency, location relevance, company context

**Part E: Final Dispositions**
- **TRACKING (2):** Synthflow AI, Symmetric Health Solutions
- **SKIPPED (4):** Forethought AI, Virtual Vocations, Qevlar AI, GeneMetrics
- Skipped leads remain in applications.json (flagged, won't resurface)
- Pipeline clean for tomorrow's 6:45 AM automated run

### 4. CRON PIPELINE READY FOR TOMORROW (6:00–6:45 AM)
- 6:00 AM: Contact CRM Daily Update
- 6:15 AM: Daily Briefing → Telegram + Drive (briefings/ folder)
- 6:30 AM: X Content Scout → Telegram + Drive (x-drafts/ folder)
- 6:45 AM: Job Scout → Telegram + Drive (job-scout/ folder) — **New source hierarchy active**

## Key Decisions & Context

**Job Scout Targeting Shift:**
Casey's profile is rare: 13 years enterprise tech (Red Hat, Kiewit, Burns & McDonnell) + hands-on AI/ML knowledge. He's a sales leader who can build what he sells. Job scout is now optimized for enterprise sales roles at scale-stage B2B SaaS companies where that combination matters.

**Source Quality Finding:**
Aggregator boards (RemoteRocketship, Virtual Vocations) surface roles 1-2 weeks late and strip company context. Direct sources (Wellfound, LinkedIn, company pages) provide first-look access to new roles with full context and accurate comp. Shift confirmed as correct strategy.

**Application Pipeline Status:**
6 total leads across all sources and runs today. 2 TRACKING for ongoing review, 4 SKIPPED (decision made). Ready for new leads from tomorrow's automated run.

## Files Modified (Summary)

**Local:**
- job-scout.md (source hierarchy, company tracking rules, weekly reset schedule)
- applications.json (5 initial leads appended, then dispositions updated, final state: 2 TRACKING, 4 SKIPPED, 1 new TRACKING)
- MEMORY.md (Job Scout Company Watchlist Tracking table added)
- tracker.json (4 task completions, 2 updates to notes)

**Drive:**
- Created x-drafts/ folder (ID: 1FFj2Zv8u6J3LsmTWU5Cn9hxiRHvnKXQf)
- Created job-scout/ folder (ID: 1_r4ykfESPOwiF6I1d3SfCYkjbReAfVEj)
- Created 2026-02-25-job-scout.md (with re-run appended section showing quality comparison)
- Updated applications.json (6 leads total, statuses finalized)
- Updated job-scout.md (skill definition with new source hierarchy)
- Updated tracker.json (4 tasks complete, 2 blocking/status notes)

**Git:**
- Committed: "Upgrade job scout source hierarchy: prioritize LinkedIn + company career pages, deprioritize aggregators, add company tracking system"

## Notes for SuperStan

1. **Tracker is now current** (Feb 25 reconciliation locked in). 4 major tasks marked complete. Website + ICP work done.
2. **X pipeline & Job Scout infrastructure are production-ready.** Both have dual output (Telegram + Drive archival) and are configured for tomorrow's cron runs.
3. **Job Scout targeting is locked to enterprise sales only.** No more Solutions Architect / SE roles surfacing. Quality should improve significantly with primary source shift.
4. **Application pipeline is clean:** 2 leads TRACKING (monitoring), 4 SKIPPED (decision made). Ready for fresh discovery tomorrow.
5. **File ID audit completed:** applications.json using correct direct file ID (not folder ID). job-scout.py refactored for safety.
