# Feb 9, 2026 - Session Work Log

## Real Estate Analysis (PRIORITY LIVE TASK)
**Property:** 111 Valley View St, Canyon Lake TX 78133 | $135K listing | MLS#585187

**What We Have:**
- 3bed/2bath, 955 sq ft, built 1965
- Listed as "Multiple family property" (potential duplex/triplex setup)
- Realtor: Chelsea Evans (Real Broker LLC, 15+ yrs exp) - verified solid
- Viewing partner: Dwayne Moser
- Basic market comp research done

**Critical Gaps (NEXT STEPS - before group walkthrough):**
- Lot size (affect rental potential, land value)
- Tax history + price history (market trend)
- Days on market (negotiation signal)
- HOA status + fees (if applicable)
- Flood zone designation (major risk/insurance impact)
- Septic vs. sewer (operational cost difference)
- Rehab estimates (actual condition assessment needed)
- Rental comps (what can we charge?)
- Cash flow + cap rate calculations (investment viability)
- **Walkthrough questions:** 5-7 smart questions to ask Chelsea during viewing

**Next Action:** Stan researches gaps via MLS, county records, Zillow, Redfin + flood maps. Generate walkthrough Q&A before Casey's group viewing.

## Operational Decisions Locked (Feb 9)

### SuperStan Authority Changed
- **SuperStan now owns Trello writes** (MCP direct API access)
- **Stan is read-only on Trello** (pulls to KANBAN.md for local cache only)
- **New workflow:** Stan reports work completion → SuperStan updates master tracker + Trello → Stan pulls fresh KANBAN.md
- **Implication:** Trello is source of truth; KANBAN.md is local working copy

### Model Runtime Issue
**CRITICAL:** Currently running Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-5), should be Haiku (claude-haiku-4-5)
- Cost optimization preference locked in constraints
- Corrections loop ensures quality
- **Action needed:** Switch runtime back to Haiku when Casey approves

### Compute Diversification Finalized
- **SuperStan (claude.ai):** Architecture, decisions, prompt engineering, Trello/Drive/Gmail/Calendar API writes
- **NotebookLM:** Research synthesis, pattern extraction
- **Perplexity:** Real-time discovery, trend research
- **Stan:** Execution, file ops, Telegram, task verification
- **Don't cross streams:** SuperStan doesn't execute; Stan doesn't architect
