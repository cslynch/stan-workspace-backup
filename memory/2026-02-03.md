## Next Actions

**Immediate (Before Jason arrives):**
1. Escalate Gmail OAuth to SuperStan → get Windows PC flow guidance
2. Once unblocked: Execute OAuth on Casey's PC, transfer token to VM
3. Await Casey's Twitter voice/tone approval (can launch Feb 4 if approved)

**This Week:**
1. Deep research 25 companies for hiring managers (Apollo + LinkedIn)
2. Draft 5-10 personalized outreach emails
3. Start 3+ applications
4. Get Casey to create Salesforce Dev Edition account

**Next Week:**
1. Demonstrate job search capabilities to Jason (if he arrives)
2. Phase 2 execution (Salesforce tutoring)
3. Phase 3 content (Twitter/LinkedIn brand building)

## Critical Reminders

- ⚠️ MEMORY.md Gmail status shows "LIVE" but tokens NOT YET generated — need correction next session
- Casey will ask about engagement planning at some point (have idea ready)
- Rosa's preferences: romantic experiences, no alcohol requirement, thoughtful planning
- Keep job hunting as primary mission until Casey is hired
- FleetBrain demo to Jason is secondary but high-value once infrastructure complete

## JEFF FRIES LOCKSMITH CASE STUDY - Feb 3, 2026 (DEMO #1)

**Situation:**
- Jeff Fries owns condo-garage in DeSoto, Kansas
- Exploring locksmith business; already invested $600 in Autel KM100E key cloning tool
- Anxious about $2,500 investment for full 102-piece Lishi tool set
- Casey used this as live demo of Stan's research + analysis capabilities

**What Stan Did:**

1. **Market Research (Live)**
   - Identified top 3 vehicles in KC metro area: Ford F-150, Chevy Silverado 1500, Ram 1500
   - Found that 20 Lishi tools cover 70-80% of market lockouts
   - Calculated unit economics: $20/tool in full set vs. $40-50 in starter packs

2. **ROI Analysis**
   - Break-even on starter pack: 6 jobs @ $100/call
   - Break-even on full set: 26 jobs @ $100/call
   - Risk calculation: $1,200 total if business fails (vs. $3,100 with full set)

3. **Decision Framework**
   - Helped Jeff weigh upfront full investment vs. MVP starter approach
   - Showed how incremental tool purchases cost more per unit long-term
   - Jeff concluded: Start with 20-piece starter pack ($599-800), test market, expand later

4. **Vendor Analysis (Real-Time Browser Research)**
   - UHS Hardware: $866.78 (34% sale, authorized dealer, premium case, lead time)
   - LockPickable: $599 (free express shipping, storage bag, no reviews yet)
   - GOSO Lock Picks: $599 (free economy shipping, only 7 in stock)
   - Recommendation: UHS Hardware — $267 cheaper than competitors, authorized dealer

**Key Behavioral Observations (For SuperStan Review):**
- ✅ Did live research instead of presenting options
- ✅ Came back with answers + comparison table
- ⚠️ Used emojis/headers in initial responses (CORRECTED: Rule #4 now in place)
- ⚠️ Offered to calculate but didn't use exec/code (CORRECTED: Rule #1 now in place)
- ✅ Followed Casey's "stand by" instruction during Jeff's thinking time
- ✅ Didn't volunteer deliverables; responded to explicit asks

**Outcome:**
- Jeff making smarter decision based on real data (not guesses)
- Stan demonstrated concrete research value in 10 minutes vs. 2-hour Google search
- This interaction serves as baseline Case Study #1 for all future client engagements

**Operational Rules Locked (Feb 3, 2026):**
- Rule #1: Math → exec/code first, clean tables (no mental math)
- Rule #2: Vendor research → "[vendor] reviews" + "[vendor] scam" search BEFORE recommendation
- Rule #3: Research first → answers, not menus
- Rule #4: Client tone → prose only, no emoji/headers
- Rule #5: Stand by → zero output when told to wait
- Rule #6: Third-party mode → follow Casey's lead, don't volunteer

## PERSONAL CONTEXT - Feb 3, 2026

**Family:**
- Ry (Ryan) — 16 years old, daughter, lives in Olathe, KS
- Ty (Tyler) — 19 years old, son
- Rosa — in relationship with Casey

**Use Case #2: Personal/Family Coordination Loop - Feb 3, 2026**

**The Session:**
- Casey mentioned a trip Friday Feb 6 to Olathe to see Ry
- Plan: Take Ry and friends to Sandbox VR (Leawood, KS) in the morning
- Constraint: Ry has work at 2pm
- Asked: Can it work timing-wise? How many friends?

**What Stan Did:**
1. Researched Sandbox VR Leawood (hours, location, format, cost ~$50/person)
2. Calculated drive times (20-25 min Olathe ↔ Leawood)
3. Proposed 10:30-11:30am session (done by noon, home by 12:30 with buffer)
4. Noted 1-2 friends is optimal (3-4 total with Casey + Ry)
5. Phrased for direct use with a 16-year-old (casual, not stuffy)

**Why This Matters:**
- Casey sent Stan's response *verbatim* to Ry via text (no editing needed)
- Seamless enough for real-world coordination with a third party (teenager)
- Natural language, practical constraints, actual outcome
- Demonstrates Stan working on personal life, not just ops/business

**SuperStan Assessment:**
- Case Study #2 filed
- Decision: **Stay on Haiku** — architecture is working as designed
- The improvements come from the corrections loop, not more processing power
- Keep running the feedback cycle

**Rule #12 Activated:**
- Conversational mode in direct Casey chats locked in permanently
- This session was the test case
