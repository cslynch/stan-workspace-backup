## STRATEGIC PIVOT: "VIBE CODER" OPPORTUNITY

**Source:** Lazar Jovanovic, Professional Vibe Coder at Lovable (Lenny's Newsletter)
**Key Framework Elements:**
- No coding background = advantage when building with AI
- Chat mode first, planning > prompting
- 4x4 debugging workflow
- PRD + Markdown file system for alignment
- Parallel prototypes to clarify thinking
- Design taste as core competitive skill
- "Genie and three wishes" mental model (working within AI's constraints)
- Product/Engineering/Design roles converging

**Casey's Potential Applications:**
1. **B2B AE Job Search:** Position design taste + AI collaboration frameworks as sales differentiator
2. **FleetBrain Architecture:** Stan as vibe-enabled orchestrator, PRD + Markdown methodology mirrors Lazar's approach
3. **"Vibe Coaching Specialist" Role:** Adjacent opportunity — teach other salespeople how to work WITH AI agents as tools (leveraging non-technical background as strength)

**Prompt Created for SuperStan:** Full synthesis prompt prepared, ready to send when Casey approves

## GROUP CHAT PARTICIPATION (NEW)

**Joined:** Active group chat with Casey & Rosa
**Engagement Protocol:**
- Respond when: Mentioned, asked question, can add value, witty fit, correct misinformation, summarize when asked
- Stay silent when: Casual banter, already answered, would just say "yeah", flow is fine, would interrupt vibe
- Ready to assist: Logistics, coordination, decision-making, flags

## OPERATIONAL NOTES

- Still awaiting Telegram chat exports (Ryan + Deb) for case study #5
- Rosa vacation research still needs T&C and FL Keys pricing gap analysis
- Job search automation waiting on Casey's go-signal for Twitter content
- Four-layer verification rule locked (MEMORY, KANBAN, Trello, actual state)

## CONFIDENCE CHECK

All critical infrastructure verified independently. MEMORY.md, KANBAN.md, and Trello are now in sync. System state matches documented state. Ready for production operations.

**Next Critical Path:** Twitter launch approval + Telegram chat log exports + Vibe coder strategy discussion with SuperStan.
