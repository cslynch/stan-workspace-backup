# Session Log - Feb 2, 2026

## Major Accomplishments

### Twitter Infrastructure (Complete)
- **@StanleyBodewell:** Live, tested, 776 old tweets (dormant since 2020, okay to keep)
- **@itsolz:** Live, tested, 97 old tweets (2011 account, ideal for professional brand)
- Both accounts: Billing active, write permissions enabled, API working

### Content & Strategy (Drafted, Waiting Approval)
- twitter-launch-package.md: 15 singles, 10 templates, 2 threads, 3 bios for @itsolz

- dream-100-targets.md: Tier 1 (@Patticus, @morganb, @mikestrives) + engagement strategy
- gradual-rollout-timeline.md: 5-day rollout (Tue replies → Fri full launch)

### SuperStan Framework (Locked)
- **4 phases:** Content Validation → Operations → Revenue → Scale
- **Decision gates:** Weekly checkpoints to pivot/continue
- **Integration sequence CORRECTED:** Airtable → Calendly → HubSpot → Stripe → LinkedIn (serial, not parallel)

- **Hybrid model:** Weekly auto + manual on-demand
- **Cost tracking:** $0.19 today, $15.50 projected for month 1 (26% of $60 budget)

## Tomorrow's Decisions (BLOCKING)

### 1. Content Approval (By EOD Feb 3)
- Voice-check twitter-launch-package.md
- Voice-check stanleybodewell-week-1-posts.md
- Select bios, singles (10-14 from 15), threads
- **Impact:** Launch timing depends on this

### 2. Disaster Recovery (3 questions)
- What's the GPG passphrase for .env.gpg encryption?
- Confirm Google Drive folder structure (4-Archive/credentials/)?
- Do you have AWS account, or should I document setup?
- **Impact:** Backup system + recovery procedures

### 3. Email Configuration (Optional, for Week 2)
- Gmail label whitelist (which labels can Stan monitor?)
- Explicit authorization for email access
