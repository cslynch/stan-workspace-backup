## @itsolz Week 2 Themes (Feb 10-16)

**Dependent on Week 1 performance:**
- Which reply targets drove best engagement?
- Which tweet themes got traction (wins, methodology, observations)?
- Which posting times worked best?

### If Quota/Wins Posts Worked:
- Theme: "Real numbers from the field"
- Tie to actual deal wins, pipeline metrics
- Show progression (180% → 186% → what's next)
- Positioning: "Here's what quota-crushing actually looks like"

### If Automation/Tech Posts Worked:
- Theme: "How I'm building AI agents into my workflow"
- Deeper dives on specific automations (not just pitches)
- Framework-based (3-step process, 5 metrics, etc.)
- Positioning: "Technical depth that translates to pipeline"

### If Methodology/Framework Posts Worked:
- Theme: "The playbook that worked"
- Detailed breakdown of one system/process
- Step-by-step walkthrough
- Positioning: "Here's the exact framework top AEs use"

### Fallback (If Multiple Themes Tie):
- Mix: 40% winning content type + 30% secondary + 30% new testing
- Continue Dream 100 engagement (70% of effort)
- Add 2-3 new accounts identified from Week 1 replies
- Test 1 new content angle (opposite of what worked - if wins worked, test philosophy)

## @stanleybodewell Week 2 Direction (Feb 10-16)

**Dependent on Week 1 traction:**
- Which posts got shared/bookmarked?
- Which got replies from humans (signal of interest)?
- What themes generated engagement?

### If Automation Demos Worked:
- Continue daily automation showcases
- Go deeper (before/after metrics, cost comparisons)
- Engage with replies (build community)

### If Behind-the-Scenes Worked:
- More "Things Casey doesn't know I do" posts
- Day-in-the-life format
- Market watching/intelligence sharing

### If Observations/Takes Worked:
- More opinionated commentary on sales/AI trends
- Contrarian takes on industry wisdom
- Data-driven pushback on myths

### Likely Hybrid:
- 50% continue strongest performers
- 30% deepen winners (add metrics, detail, proof)
- 20% test new angles

## How This Gets Finalized

**Sunday Feb 9 (Week 1 Wrap):**
1. Analyze metrics (engagement, followers, DMs, replies)
2. Identify which content types won
3. Spot patterns in timing, wording, topics
4. Rank by: engagement rate, follower growth, DM quality

**Monday Feb 10:**
1. SuperStan + Stan analyze data
2. Recommend themes for Week 2
3. Casey approves direction
4. Full posts drafted Tuesday-Wednesday
5. Content locked by Thursday
6. Auto-schedule Friday

**Timeline:** Data → Analysis → Direction → Content → Approval (5 days)

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Force content based on theory
- ❌ Assume Week 1 patterns continue
- ❌ Dilute winners with new experiments
- ❌ Keep content that gets <5 engagement average
- ❌ Ignore DM/reply quality signals

## Success Metrics for Week 1 (To Inform Week 2)

**@itsolz:**
- Target: 50-100 new followers
- Engagement rate: >3% (likes/retweets per post)
- Dream 100 replies: 2-3 replies back per day (relationship signal)
- DMs: 5-10 inquiries (quality over volume)

**@stanleybodewell:**
- Target: 100-200 new followers (larger growth expected, more experimental)
- Engagement rate: >5% (more playful, higher shares expected)
- Community replies: 2-5 per post (building audience)

If either misses these, we pivot strategy.
