ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED

1. Michelin CrossClimate2 (205/55R16)
   • Overall: 9.2/10
   • Better winter performance (9.2 light snow vs 8.0)
   • Better treadwear (9.1 vs 7.4)
   • More expensive (~$210-230/tire vs $185-200)
   • Decision: Overkill for Texas, winter capability not needed

2. Continental TrueContact Tour (205/55R16)
   • Overall: 8.3/10
   • Best treadwear (80k+ mile warranty)
   • Lower price (~$140-160/tire)
   • Slightly less quiet than Turanza
   • Decision: Good value, but not as quiet as client priority demands

3. General Altimax RT45 (205/55R16)
   • Overall: 8.0/10
   • Budget-friendly (~$120/tire)
   • Decent comfort (8.8/10)

Data Collection Date: February 4, 2026

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

LESSONS LEARNED

1. Client stated "no budget" early, which streamlined research to premium tier only
2. Answering questions sequentially helped prioritize features (quiet > comfort > fuel economy)
3. Texas climate made winter performance irrelevant, simplifying decision
4. Long-term ownership meant treadwear mattered more than upfront cost
5. Steep/balanced driving meant touring tire (not performance) was right category

Process Improvements for Next Time:
• Could have asked about vehicle trim earlier to confirm tire size
• Could have asked if client had Costco membership upfront (pricing advantage)
• Should verify current promotions when making recommendations
