- Airtable: Free tier (no charges)
- Discord: Free (no charges)

**Total estimate:** $10-20/month (well under Casey's budget)

**Tracking:** Weekly reports every Sunday

---

## 🔐 CRITICAL DECISIONS MADE

### Chosen Path
1. **CRM:** Airtable (simpler than HubSpot)
2. **Voice:** TTS only (simplest option)
3. **Community:** Discord (Week 4, public community only)
4. **Email:** Conservative OAuth approach (prevents Gmail lockout)
5. **Priority:** Automation > Revenue-generating features

### Not Chosen (Yet)
- Slack, Google Chat (team coordination not needed yet)
- Two-way voice (TTS only for now)
- FleetBrain/RapidKey promotion on @stanleybodewell (community focus instead)
- Complex automations (start simple, add layers later)

---

## 📋 WHAT CASEY NEEDS TO DO RIGHT NOW

1. **Read & approve:** `twitter-launch-package.md`
2. **Pick bios:** 3 options for @itsolz, 3 for @stanleybodewell
3. **Pick tweets:** 10-14 from 15 singles for @itsolz
4. **Pick thread:** 1 from 2 options
5. **Provide:** @itsolz API credentials (by Feb 5)
6. **Review:** `email-safety-protocol.md` (when ready for Week 2)

---

## ✨ WHAT'S NEXT

Once Casey provides the 5 things above:

1. **Feb 5:** Configure @itsolz API
2. **Feb 6:** Final tests
3. **Feb 7:** Launch both accounts (automated)
4. **Feb 7-9:** Monitor, report daily
5. **Feb 10+:** Build integrations

---

**Status:** ✅ All documentation complete. Waiting on Casey's Twitter approvals.  
**Next Prompt:** When Casey has content approved + @itsolz credentials ready.
